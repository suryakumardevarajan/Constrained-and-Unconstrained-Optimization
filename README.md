# Constrained and Unconstrained Optimization techniques

#### ECSE 507 [project] OPTIMIZATION AND OPTIMAL CONTROL 
Optimization is an area of interest and research in this fast-paced world. Optimization is the act of ﬁnding minimum or maximum values of a function. An important distinction is between problems in which there are no constraints on the variables and problems in which there are constraints on the variables. Unconstrained optimization problems arise directly in many practical applications; they also arise in the reformulation of constrained optimization problems in which the constraints are replaced by a penalty term in the objective function. Constrained optimization problems arise from applications in which there are explicit constraints on the variables.The constraints on the variables can vary widely from simple bounds to systems of equalities and in-equalities that model complex relationships among the variables.Today, the results of unconstrained and constrained optimization are applied in diﬀerent branches of science, as well as generally in practice.
